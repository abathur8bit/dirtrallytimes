Track times from Dirt Rally races

# TODO
x Automatic is sometimes set to yes after saving a new track time
- double times when inspecting a time
- Need to be able to delete an entry
  
- when importing times, add any tracks and cars that are not already in the DB
- Create new car screen
- Create new track screen

- When adding track time, make sure to show last entry so you don't have to scroll down, or reverse sort order to new on top by default
